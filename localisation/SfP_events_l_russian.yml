 special.0.t:0 "Welcome to Sue for Peace!"
 special.0.d:0 "This mod gives three new decisions per country you are at war with, allowing you to end drawn out wars quicker (at the cost of not getting as much land).  However, the AI won't always accept, it depends on how close they are to capitulation.  This mod also allows you to redeclare war if the AI whitepeaces on your behalf (as sometimes happens with scripted events).  Lastly, there is a feature that allows the AI to ask for peace as well, however, due to bugs, you can choose to turn it off (eveyone must select "on" in multiplayer to keep it on).
